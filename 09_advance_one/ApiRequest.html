    message and what you want to say, but you haven't hit send yet.</li>
    <li>2 HEADERS_RECEIVED: You've hit send, and your friend's phone has received your message. They've seen who it's from
    and maybe the subject, but they haven't read it yet.</li>
    <li>3 LOADING: Your friend is reading your message, but they haven't finished yet. They might have read part of it, but
    they're still working on the rest.</li>
    <li>4 DONE: Your friend has finished reading your message and has responded. The conversation is complete, and you've
    received their full response.</li>
